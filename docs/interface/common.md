The Filesystem Browser
----------------------

Sometimes higan will need
to ask you to choose a file or folder.
For this, it uses a special Filesystem Browser dialog.
Although many operating systems provide a native filesystem browser,
they do not all allow the same customizations.
Therefore,
higan provides its own filesystem browser
that works the same way on every platform.

The filesystem browser shows the contents of some particular folder,
and allows you to select one of those items.

Across the top of the window,
a text-box displays the path of the current folder.
If you want to browse a specific path,
you may edit the contents of this box
and press Enter to switch to the new location.

The button with two blue arrows at the top-right is "Refresh".
Pressing this button will check for
added (or removed) items in the current folder,
and add (or remove) them to (or from) the list.

The button with the house at the top-right is "Home".
Pressing this button will switch to your home folder.

The button with the green up-arrow at the top right is "Parent".
Pressing this button will
switch to the parent of the current folder.

Most of the filesystem browser lists the contents
of the current folder.
Double-clicking a folder,
or selecting it and pressing Enter,
will switch to showing the contents of that folder.
If the list has keyboard focus,
typing any text will jump to the first inem in the list
whose name begins with the text you typed.

If a drop-down list appears in the bottom-left,
it allows you to choose which files appear in the list,
based on file-extension.

If this filesystem browser is asking for a file,
you can choose one
by double-clicking it,
by selecting it and pressing Enter,
or by selecting it and clicking the "Select" button in the bottom-right.

If this filesystem browser is asking for a folder,
you can choose one
by selecting it and clicking the "Select" button in the bottom-right.
Double-clicking
or selecting and pressing Enter don't work,
they just switch to viewing that folder.

The "Cancel" button in the bottom-right
closes the filesystem browser without selecting anything.
