The unofficial higan repository
===============================

higan emulates a number of classic videogame consoles of the 1980s and 1990s,
allowing you to play classic games on a modern general-purpose computer.

This repository includes
the source-code for
stable and WIP releases of higan,
starting during the development of v068.
It also includes community-maintained documentation.

Basically,
apart from `.gitignore` files,
anything in the
[higan](higan/),
[hiro](hiro/),
[icarus](icarus/),
[libco](libco/),
[nall](nall/),
[ruby](ruby/),
or [shaders](shaders/)
directories should be exactly as it appeared in official releases.
Everything else has been added for various reasons.
