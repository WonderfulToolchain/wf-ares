higan, the multi-system emulator
================================

higan emulates a number of classic videogame consoles of the 1980s and 1990s,
allowing you to play classic games on a modern general-purpose computer.

As of v102,
higan has top-tier support for the following consoles:

  - Nintendo Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System,
    including addon hardware:
      - Super Game Boy
      - Sufami Turbo
  - Nintendo Game Boy Advance

It also includes some level of support for these consoles:

  - BS-X Satellaview addon for the Super Famicom
  - Nintendo Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System
  - Nintendo Game Boy
  - Nintendo Game Boy Color
  - Sega Master System
  - Sega Game Gear
  - Sega Megadrive/Genesis
  - NEC PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16 (but not the CD-ROMÂ² System/TurboGrafx-CD)
  - NEC SuperGrafx
  - Bandai Wonderswan
  - Bandai Wonderswan Color

higan is actively supported on
FreeBSD 10 and above, and
Microsoft Windows 7 and above.
It also includes some level of support
for GNU/Linux and macOS.

higan is officially spelled with a lowercase "h", not a capital.

Unofficial higan resources

  - [Source code repository](https://gitlab.com/higan/higan/)
    archives official higan releases
    and WIP snapshots
    since approximately v067r21.
  - [Quark shader repository](https://github.com/hizzlekizzle/quark-shaders)
    collects shaders that higan can use
    to add special effects like TV scanlines to its video output,
    or smarter algorithms for scaling up to modern PC resolutions.
    See [Installing custom shaders][shaders] below for details.
  - [Mercurial Magic](https://github.com/hex-usr/Mercurial-Magic/)
    is a tool for converting MSU-1 games and mods into a format
    higan can use.
    See [Importing MSU-1 games][msu1] below for details.

There are also other projects
based on current or older versions of higan,
in whole or in part,
that you might want to check out.

  - [Mednafen](https://mednafen.github.io/)
    is another multi-system emulator.
    Its SNES emulation is based on bsnes v059,
    from the time before bsnes was renamed to higan.
  - [BizHawk](http://tasvideos.org/BizHawk.html)
    is another multi-system emulator,
    specialising in the creation of
    tool-assisted speedruns.
    Its SNES emulation is based on bsnes v087.
  - [nSide](https://github.com/hex-usr/nSide)
    is a fork of higan that greatly enhances
    its NES emulation support,
    and adds minor features to the other cores too.
    It also restores the "balanced" SNES emulation core
    that was removed from higan in v099,
    which is less CPU intensive
    than the current accuracy-focussed core.
  - [bsnes-plus](https://github.com/devinacker/bsnes-plus)
    is a fork of bsnes v073
    that adds improved support for debugging SNES software.

Installing and uninstalling higan
=================================

The best way to install higan
depends on what platform you're using,
as well as whether you want to use official binaries
or compile the source-code from scratch.

Installing an official release on Windows
-----------------------------------------

Official higan releases are distributed in [7-zip][7z] archives.
You will need to install 7-zip,
or another compatible archiving tool,
to install higan.

[7z]: http://www.7-zip.org/

Once you have a suitable archiving tool,
extract the contents of the higan archive into a new directory.

When you're done,
the new directory should contain `higan.exe` and `icarus.exe`
along with other assorted files and directories
that describe the systems higan emulates.

You may put that directory wherever you like.

To run higan, open the `higan.exe` file.

Before you can actually play games,
you'll need to [import them][#importing-games]
and [configure higan][#configuring-higan].

Uninstalling an official release on Windows
-------------------------------------------

Delete the directory containing `higan.exe`
and the other associated data from the original archive.

To remove higan's configuration:

 1. Press Win+R to open the Run dialog
 2. Type `%LOCALAPPDATA%` and press Enter
    to open the folder where higan's configuration data lives
 3. Delete the subdirectories named `icarus` and `higan`
    if they exist.

You might also want to remove the games imported into higan's library
(including in-game saves and save-states):

 1. Press Win+R to open the Run dialog
 2. Type `%USERPROFILE%` and press Enter
    to open the folder where higan keeps its game library
 3. Delete the subdirectory named `Emulation` if it exists

Compiling from source on Windows
--------------------------------

You will need a copy of the higan source-code.
If you download an official release from the higan homepage,
you will need [7-zip][7z] or a compatible tool to extract it.
Alternatively,
you may obtain higan source code from
[the unofficial git repo](https://gitlab.com/higan/higan/)
using the Git source-code management tool,
or by clicking the download button on the right-hand side of the web-page
and choosing an archive format.

You will need a C++ compiler to compile higan.
We recommend installing [TDM64-GCC][tdm],
preferably the latest version
but anything newer than 4.9 should be fine.
higan does not support building with clang++
(Clang is still not quite there yet for Windows)
nor Microsoft Visual C++
(last we checked, it didn't support all the C++ features higan uses).

**Note:** Make sure you get TDM64-GCC,
not TDM-GCC.
When compiled in x86 (32-bit) mode,
higan may crash at startup
because gcc targeting x86 does not support
Windows' structured exception handling (SEH).
Also,
historically in x86 mode
gcc has miscompiled a part of the NES emulation core.
See the higan forum
[for](https://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?p=41977#p41977)
[details](https://board.byuu.org/viewtopic.php?p=42253#p42253).

Once you've installed mingw-w64,
open a command-prompt window,
type `g++ --version`
then press Enter
to check it's installed correctly.
You should see a message like

    g++ 1.2.3 20010101
    Copyright (C) 2001 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
    warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

...except it should mention the version of mingw that you installed
and the corresponding dates.
If you see an error message like "command not found"
or "bad command or filename",
you may need to add mingw's "bin" directory
to your computer's `%PATH%`.
See the mingw documentation for help with that.

Once mingw is installed and available from the command prompt:

 1. Put the higan source code in some convenient location,
    like `C:\higan-src`
 2. Open the command-prompt
 3. Type `cd C:\higan-src`
    (or wherever you put the higan source)
    and press Enter
 4. Type `mingw32-make -C icarus compiler=g++` and press Enter
    to build the icarus import tool
 5. Type `mingw32-make -C higan compiler=g++` and press Enter
    to build the main higan executable
 6. In Windows Explorer,
    create a new directory to hold the working copy of higan
 7. Copy `C:\higan-src\icarus\out\icarus.exe`
    into the new directory
 8. Copy `C:\higan-src\icarus\Database` and its contents
    into the new directory
 9. Copy `C:\higan-src\higan\out\higan.exe`
    into the new directory
 10. Copy all the `*.sys` directories
    in `C:\higan-src\higan\systems`
    into the new directory

The new directory should now contain
`icarus.exe`,
`higan.exe`,
a directory named `Database`,
and half a dozen directories named after the systems higan emulates
with `.sys` at the end.
This is what you would get by downloading an official build,
as described under "Installing an official release on Windows" above.

Compiling from source on Linux
------------------------------

You will need a copy of the higan source-code.
If you download an official release from the higan homepage,
you will need [7-zip][7z] or a compatible tool to extract it.

[the unofficial git repo](https://gitlab.com/higan/higan/)
using the Git source-code management tool,
or by clicking the download button on the right-hand side of the web-page
and choosing an archive format.

You will also need GCC 4.9 or higher,
including the C and C++ compiler,
GNU Make,
and development files
(headers, etc.)
for the following libraries:

  - GTK 2.x
  - PulseAudio
  - Mesa
  - gtksourceview 2.x
  - Cairo
  - SDL 1.2
  - libXv
  - libAO
  - OpenAL
  - udev

On a Debian-derived Linux distribution,
you can install everything you need with a command like:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libpulse-dev \
        mesa-common-dev libgtksourceview2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libsdl1.2-dev \
        libxv-dev libao-dev libopenal-dev libudev-dev
