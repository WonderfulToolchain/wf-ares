higan
=====

higan is a multi-system emulator with an uncompromising focus on accuracy and
code readability.

It is a research project meant to improve all emulators through open source
collaboration, and as such is not meant to be used as a standard emulator for
playing games (although it can be used as such with some patience.)

Testing is greatly appreciated so that the emulation quality can be improved.
Such improvements will migrate downstream to user-focused emulators such as
bsnes.

It currently emulates the following systems: Famicom, Famicom Disk System,
Super Famicom, Super Game Boy, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance,
Game Boy Player, SG-1000, SC-3000, Master System, Game Gear, Mega Drive,
Mega CD, PC Engine, SuperGrafx, MSX, MSX2, ColecoVision, Neo Geo Pocket,
Neo Geo Pocket Color, WonderSwan, WonderSwan Color, SwanCrystal,
Pocket Challenge V2.
